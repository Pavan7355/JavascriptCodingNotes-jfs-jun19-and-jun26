//Asynchronous Programming

//Asynchronous programming is a programming paradim that
//allows tasks to be executed concurrently, without bloxking
//the main tread of execution.
//this approach is particularly useful when dealing with
//operation that might take time to complete.
//such as network request , file I/O allowing the programm
//to contiune running other tasks

//asynchronous programming can be done by using 
//timers,promises,async and await
